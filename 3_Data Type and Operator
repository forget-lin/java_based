    3_5_3_Automatic Promotion of Expression Type
          Promotion Rules：
          1.All of byte,short and char type will promote to int type.
          2.The entire arithmetic expression will be raised to 
            the same level as the highest-level operand of the current expression.

    3_7_8_Combination and Priority of Operators
          Notice the short circuit of the operator，like “||”，which will skip the next judgement condition.
          The operator priority table，the previous line always takes precedence over the next:
                  Separator                                    [] {} () , ;
                  Unary operator                               ++ -- ~ !
                  Mandatory type converter                    （type）
                  Multiplication/Division/Remainder            * / %
                  Addition and Subtraction                     + -
                  Shift Operators                              >> << >>>
                  Relational Operators                         < <= > => instanceof
                  Equivalent Operators                         == !=
                  AND Operators                                &
                  Bitwise XOR                                  ^
                  Bitwise OR                                   |
                  Condition AND                                &&
                  Condition OR                                 ||
                  Ternary Operator                             ? :
                  Volution Operator                            = += -= *= /= &= |= ^= %= <<= >>= >>>=
          Do not raly  too much on the priority of operator to control expressions.
