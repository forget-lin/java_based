            case:   int[] b = new int[5];
                    int[] a = {5,7,10};
                    //At this point, the length of the b array is 5 and the length of A is 3.
                    b=a;
                    //At this point,  b.length is 3 and a.length is 3 
                    because of both array variables point to the same array in memory.
                    This creates the illusion that the length of the array changes.
